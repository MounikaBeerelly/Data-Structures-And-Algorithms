1. In javascript, use 'this' keyword inside the nested functions, then this keyword lose the reference of the object.
 >
            var myCar = {
            color: "Blue",
            logColor: function() {
                var self = this;
                console.log("In logColor - this.color: " + this.color);
                console.log("In logColor - self.color: " + self.color);
                (function() {
                    console.log("In IIFE - this.color: " + this.color);
                    console.log("In IIFE - self.color: " + self.color);
                })();
              }
            };
            
            myCar.logColor();
  >
     Output: 
        Blue
        Blue
        undefined
        Blue
-> If we define this.color = red; outside a function, then it returns red insted of undefined. Because , here this refers to the global object.

2. Call & Apply methods
-> any function defined in javascript, will be able to use the call method. It passes arguments as comma seperated.

### Pass by Value:
- In Pass by Value, Function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function doesnâ€™t affect the variable passed from outside the function.
- Javascript always pass by value so changing the value of the variable never changes the underlying primitive (String or number).
- However, when a variable refers to an object which includes array, the value is the reference to the object.
### Pass by Reference: 
- In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affect the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript objects and arrays follows pass by reference.
- so if we are passing object or array as an argument to the method, then there is a possibility that value of the object can change.
